# Linear regression model

Implementaiton of linear regression from scratch to make a model that will predict house prices in London.  
The dataset chosen as the training sample comprises of various house listings in London and neighbouring region. It also encompasses the parameters listed below.

- Property Name
- Price
- House Type - Contains one of the following types of houses (House, Flat/Apartment, New Development, Duplex, Penthouse, Studio, Bungalow, Mews)
- Area in sq ft
- No. of Bedrooms
- No. of Bathrooms
- No. of Receptions
- Location
- City/County - Includes London, Essex, Middlesex, Hertfordshire, Kent, and Surrey.
- Postal Code

For the simple linear regression model I will only be looking at the `Price` and `Area in sq ft` properties.  
As the data set is from Londons house prices I am expecting to get a lot of outliers due to the nature of Londons property market.
